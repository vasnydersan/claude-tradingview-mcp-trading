## What This Does

1. Reads your trading strategy from `rules.json`
2. Pulls live indicator data from your TradingView chart via MCP
3. Calculates MACD from raw price data (works on the **free TradingView plan**)
4. Runs a safety check — every condition in your strategy must pass
5. Executes a trade via BitGet only if all conditions are met
6. Logs every decision to `safety-check-log.json` — full audit trail

---

## The One-Shot Prompt

> **This is the thing you paste.** Open Claude Code in this directory, paste the entire contents of [`prompts/02-one-shot-trade.md`](prompts/02-one-shot-trade.md), and Claude will do the rest.

Here's what it does when you run it:

| Step | What Claude does |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Reads your `rules.json` strategy |
| 2 | Pulls live price + indicator data from TradingView |
| 3 | Calculates MACD from raw candle data |
| 4 | Evaluates market bias (bullish / bearish / neutral) |
| 4b | Checks trade limits — daily cap and max trade size |
| 5 | Runs the safety check — every entry condition checked |
| 6 | Executes the trade via BitGet if all conditions pass |
| 7 | Saves a log of every decision made |

If anything fails the safety check, it stops and tells you exactly which condition failed and the actual values. No trade goes through unless everything lines up.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The TradingView MCP from the first video must already be set up. If you haven't done that yet, [watch the first video](https://youtu.be/vIX6ztULs4U) and come back.

---

### Step 1 — Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackson-video-resources/claude-tradingview-mcp-trading
cd claude-tradingview-mcp-trading
```

---

### Step 2 — Add your BitGet API credentials

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

```
BITGET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BITGET_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
BITGET_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase_here
PORTFOLIO_VALUE_USD=1000
```

**Getting your BitGet API key:**
- Go to your BitGet account → API Management
- Create a new API key
- **Withdrawals: OFF** — always, no exceptions
- **IP whitelist: ON** — add your own IP so the key only works from your machine
- Copy the key, secret key, and passphrase into your `.env`

### Step 3 — Launch TradingView and connect the MCP

**Mac:**
```bash
tv_launch
tv_health_check
```

**Windows:**
See [Windows setup guide](docs/setup-windows.md) — the path to your TradingView executable is different. Full walkthrough there.

**Linux:**
See [Linux setup guide](docs/setup-linux.md).

Your chart should be on BTCUSDT (or whatever you're trading), 4H timeframe, with your strategy indicator and RSI 14 visible.

---

### Step 4 — Run the one-shot prompt

Open Claude Code in the project directory and paste the full contents of [`prompts/02-one-shot-trade.md`](prompts/02-one-shot-trade.md).

That's it.

---

## Deploy to Railway (Run in the Cloud 24/7)

The local setup runs when your laptop is open. Railway lets the bot check for setups around the clock — even while you sleep.

> **Note:** Cloud mode pulls candle data directly from Binance's free market API instead of TradingView. No TradingView Desktop needed in the cloud. The strategy logic and safety check are identical.

### 1. Deploy

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 2. Set your environment variables in Railway

Go to your Railway project → Variables and add everything from `.env.example`:

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `BITGET_API_KEY` | your key |
| `BITGET_SECRET_KEY` | your secret |
| `BITGET_PASSPHRASE` | your passphrase |
| `PORTFOLIO_VALUE_USD` | 1000 |
| `MAX_TRADE_SIZE_USD` | 100 |
| `MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY` | 3 |
| `PAPER_TRADING` | true (set to false when ready) |
| `SYMBOL` | BTCUSDT |
| `TIMEFRAME` | 4H |

### 3. Set a cron schedule

In Railway → Settings → Cron Schedule, set how often the bot runs. Recommended:

| Timeframe | Schedule | What it means |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 4H chart | `0 */4 * * *` | Every 4 hours |
| 1D chart | `0 9 * * *` | Once a day at 9am UTC |
| 1H chart | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |

### 4. Start in paper trading mode

`PAPER_TRADING=true` logs every decision but never places real orders. Watch a few days of paper trades, confirm the logic matches what you expect, then flip it to `false`.

## Build Your Own Strategy (Optional)

The example `rules.json` uses the van de Poppe + Tone Vays BTC strategy. To build one from any trader's public videos:

1. Scrape their YouTube transcripts using [Apify](https://apify.com/streamers/youtube-transcript?fpr=3ly3yd) — takes about 30 seconds per channel
2. Paste the output into `prompts/01-extract-strategy.md`
3. Run that prompt in Claude Code — it generates a `rules.json` tailored to that trader's methodology

---

## Files

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `rules.json` | Your strategy — indicators, entry rules, risk rules |
| `.env` | Your BitGet credentials (gitignored — never commits) |
| `prompts/01-extract-strategy.md` | Build rules.json from trader transcripts |
| `prompts/02-one-shot-trade.md` | **The one-shot prompt — paste this to trade** |
| `safety-check-log.json` | Auto-generated log of every trade decision |
| `docs/setup-windows.md` | Windows-specific MCP setup |
| `docs/setup-linux.md` | Linux-specific MCP setup |

---

## Safety

- The safety check blocks any trade that doesn't meet every condition
- Position sizing uses your risk rules — default max 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- Stop loss is placed automatically at the level defined in your rules
- Every decision is logged with the exact values that triggered it

**This is not financial advice.** Build your strategy properly. Run the backtest. Paper trade before going live. Never put in more than you can afford to lose.
